          Ernestina Enríquez Fierro says her youngest daughter, Adriana Sarmiento Enríquez, 15, was last seen alive in January 2008 catching a bus in Juárez’s city
          center after school. Enríquez Fierro, who supports her family as a housekeeper, says they searched “every area downtown, every neighborhood, every bus … we
          never found her.” Enríquez Fierro says she learned in November 2011 via Facebook that a government forensics office had found her daughter’s remains in 2009
          in San Agustín in the Valle de Juárez, about an hour from her home. No one had told her. “Before living this nightmare that I think I will never wake up from,
          I trusted the police … I realized everything was a lie; there are no authorities, there’s no justice, there’s no respect, there’s nothing … nobody gets
          punished.”

        <div>Adriana Sarmiento Enríquez, 15, had a lot of friends from a young age. She loved music, dancing and collecting toy frogs.
        She remembered her loved one’s birthdays, and often woke them up by singing “Happy Birthday.” “When my mom died, people
        called me ‘the orphan.’ When my husband died, I became a widow … There’s no word to describe this,” Ernestina Enríquez
        Fierro says about the loss of her daughter. (Erika Schultz / The Seattle Times)
