  <p>With restaurants and bars boarded up and schools shut down, Seattle certainly feels socially distant. But knowing exactly how many people are complying with government orders to stay home is an imprecise science.</p>
  
  <p>Gov. Jay Inslee’s office focuses on the spread of the virus through rates of positive test results and hospitalizations, a spokesman said, but there are only imperfect measures to know how many of us are staying away from others.</p>

        <p>Traffic volumes on Interstate 5 through Seattle have fallen by at least half, and King County transit ridership has dropped 70 percent. Seattle police and automated cameras issued fewer traffic and parking tickets last month than in previous years, municipal court data shows.</p>

        <p>But traffic drops have been more significant here than in some other parts of the state. And cellphone data showing how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html" target="blank">travel has reduced across the country</a> also showed areas of southern and Central Washington <a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/visitation-insights-covid19/" target="blank">where people appeared to be moving around more</a> than the Seattle area.

  <p>Our garbage offers another clue. Overall solid waste volumes for Seattle Public Utilities have fallen 15%, with big drops in commercial areas, the city says. Water and electricity use are down, too, by between 2% and 6%, according to Puget Sound Energy and Seattle City Light.</p>

  <p>Other things are impossible to measure: how many people are passing too close to others on a sidewalk, sidling up in the grocery store checkout line or venturing on illicit Frisbee outings and clandestine visits to friends. Seattle police have been spotted in parks <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/outdoor-crowds-test-the-limits-of-social-distancing-in-fight-against-coronavirus/" target="blank">instructing groups of people to disperse</a>.</p>

  <p>One more count of who’s not staying home: Amid ongoing confusion over what exactly <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/a-boatyard-servicing-yachts-house-cleaners-and-pool-installer-among-essential-firms-operating-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="blank">counts as “essential,”</a> the state has received 13,000 complaints alleging nonessential businesses remain open, the governor’s office says.</p>
