        Widespread testing for COVID-19 in Washington remains spotty, plagued at times by limited availability of test kits, laggard test results, constraints on lab capacity, shortages of lab materials and persistent data problems. 
        The shortcomings point to an undercount of cases that blindfolds public health officials to the full extent of the virus’s spread.  
        Nonetheless, Washington stacks up favorably when compared to other states.
        As of Thursday, Washington’s Department of Health was reporting that more than 88,000 people in Washington had been tested, with nearly 9,100 people confirmed positive and 427 deaths. But those figures already were six days old, based on an update as of 11:59 p.m. April 3.
        Washington's 110 tests for every 10,000 residents ranked only behind Louisiana (138) and New York (111) among U.S. states that have performed at least 10,000 tests, based on census data and test monitoring by The COVID Tracking Project. Overall, Washington was 5th nationwide in total number of tests performed.

        Stale, incomplete and inaccurate data has hampered DOH’s public case counts for weeks, as the state scrambled to fix a software problem that stymied consistent updates last month.
        Washington’s troubles aren’t unique. The national testing response to the coronavirus pandemic has been riddled with problems from the start, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched a nationwide rollout of test kits to public health labs. 
        Limited early testing allowed the virus to spread undetected in Washington, and problems persisted as the state tried to play catch-up. Testing availability, however, expanded statewide in recent weeks. As of Friday, at least 15 laboratories were operating, including several within some of the state’s biggest hospital systems.
        Slow turnaround times on test results - up to two weeks or more in March - appear to be dropping in April. The UW Medicine’s virology lab, which has handled the bulk of testing statewide, reported median test results of 7 to 10 hours and announced it was expanding capacity.
        One of the biggest limiting factors to expansion is access to test kits, which include swabs and specimen-preserving chemicals. Amid national shortages, UW Medicine has taken great lengths to find suppliers in China and managed to ship some 80,000 kits to Seattle last week for distribution across the state, with the intention to buy more. 
        Testing availability will help determine when distancing measures and limitations on the economy can be rescinded. 
        “Testing is really fundamental to our ability to open up our community again and minimize the risk as we go forward,” said Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health -- Seattle & King County.

<p>Who is killing the women of Ciudad Juárez?</i></p>

<p>It’s a question that has consumed the public imagination and fueled media fascination. Authorities in Juárez have blamed serial killers,
  gangs and even the women themselves, some of whom they claimed were living double lives as sex workers.</p>

<p>For Cynthia Bejarano, who has researched femicide as a professor of gender and sexuality studies at New Mexico State University, “who” is not the
  right question to ask. “ ‘Why is it that it’s ongoing? Why is it that it’s happening in every community, in every corner of the world?’
  That should be the issue,” Bejarano says.</p>

<p>The reasons are complex and multilayered, residing at the intersections of privilege, class and gender.</p>

<p>In Juárez, rampant impunity gives perpetrators confidence they won’t be caught. The vast majority of crimes are never punished,
  according to many researchers, including some Mexican government studies.</p>
