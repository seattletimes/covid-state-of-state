  <p>Widespread testing for COVID-19 in Washington remains spotty, plagued at times by limited availability of testing materials, laggard test results and persistent data problems.</p>
  <p>The shortcomings point to an undercount of cases that blindfolds public health officials to the full extent of the virus’ spread.</p>

Overall, Washington was seventh nationwide in the total number of tests performed.</p>

        <p>Limited early testing allowed the virus to spread undetected in Washington, and problems persisted as the state tried to play catch-up. Testing availability, however, expanded statewide in recent weeks. As of Friday, at least 15 laboratories were operating, including several within some of the state’s biggest hospital systems.</p>

    Another glitch — <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/delayed-coronavirus-test-results-strain-washingtons-resources-and-leave-patients-in-limbo/" target="blank">slow turnaround times for test results</a> — appears to be easing, as wait times up to two weeks or more in March have been dropping in April. UW Medicine’s virology lab, which handles most testing statewide, reports median test results of seven to 10 hours with expanding capacity.</p>

  <p>One big problem remains: limited access to test kits, including swabs and specimen-preserving chemicals. Amid national shortages, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/uw-medicine-small-business-amazon-combine-to-airlift-key-testing-swabs-from-china-in-coronavirus-fight/" target="blank">UW Medicine went to great lengths</a> to find suppliers in China and managed to ship 80,000 kits to Seattle last week, with the intention to buy more.</p>

  <p>Widespread testing availability is “really fundamental to our ability to open up our community again and minimize the risk as we go forward,” said Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County.</p>
