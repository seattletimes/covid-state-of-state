        <p>Mathematical models are one of the few tools available to forecast the spread of the new coronavirus and the impact of social distancing, especially since testing remains limited. Officials have relied on them heavily.</p>
        <p>Early models, based on genetic analyses from Washington state’s first patients, suggested the pathogen had been spreading silently since mid-January. At the beginning of March, when the official count stood at 13 cases, scientists at the <a href="https://www.idmod.org/" target="blank">Institute for Disease Modeling</a> (IDM) estimated there were probably more than 500 cases in Washington.</p>

        <p>As the number of confirmed cases soared exponentially, IDM estimated that, if left unchecked, the virus <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-big-will-the-coronavirus-outbreak-get-this-bellevue-scientist-is-figuring-that-out/" target="blank">could infect 25,000 people</a> in King and Snohomish counties by early April, with 400 deaths likely.</p>
        <p>The shocking numbers helped spur Gov. Jay Inslee to impose increasingly stringent measures to slow transmission. By late March, analysis of traffic patterns and anonymous Facebook data showed the measures <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/hospitalizations-for-covid-19-like-illness-declined-last-week-in-washington-offering-a-glimmer-of-hope/" target="blank">seemed to be working</a>. IDM scientists calculated that transmission rates had been roughly halved, which corresponds with a slowdown in the rate of new infections.</p>

  <p>But new data from Italy and Spain, where the epidemic seems to have peaked, led to major revisions last week. The group now forecasts about 842 deaths in Washington and says hospitalizations may have already peaked, with no bed shortages.</p>
  <p>Looking forward, the models seem to agree on one point: If social distancing is rolled back too soon, infections and deaths will soar.</p>
