<p>We do not know enough.</p>

<p>How many will be infected? How many will die? Our best guesses are still only guesses, overshadowed by uncertainty.</p>

<p>How many have already been infected? Tens of thousands of tests have been run, but nowhere near enough to map the virus’ full spread.</p>

<p>Do doctors and nurses have the protection they need? Not really, exposing them and their patients and families to dire risk.</p>

<p>Still, there is evidence for optimism. Our hospitals were going to be overrun. That danger seems to have passed. Those 500 ventilators the federal government sent us? Didn’t need 'em. The 250-bed emergency field hospital? The Army unpacked it one week and packed it up the next.</p>

<p>Send them to people who need them more.</p>

<p>The substantial sacrifices we all are making are saving lives.</p>

<p>But all around us, there remains an immense human tragedy.</p>

<p>In six weeks, nearly 500 people have died.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/thomas-lopez-a-beloved-seattle-area-taco-truck-owner-dies-from-the-coronavirus/" target="blank">taco truck owner</a>, 44 years old. A married couple, 85 and 86, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/after-52-years-of-marriage-clark-county-couple-died-of-coronavirus-caused-illness-in-separate-rooms-within-hours-of-each-other/" target="blank">after 52 years of marriage</a>, hours apart. A <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/heartbreak-ingenuity-and-compassion-as-the-coronavirus-brought-endless-complications-to-one-familys-ordeal/" target="blank">war veteran, refugee and father of nine, 72</a>. A <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/after-driver-dies-community-transit-workers-question-whether-the-agency-is-protecting-them-from-coronavirus/" target="blank">bus driver</a>, 41. A corner grocer, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/steve-shulman-hearbeat-of-leschi-dies-from-effects-of-coronavirus-disease/" target="blank">the “heartbeat” of his neighborhood</a>, 67.</p>

<p>All were loved. Almost none got to say goodbye.</p>

<p>Half a million people in Washington have lost their jobs. More will soon.</p>

<p>So much is uncertain, tenuous. If social distancing is working, what happens when we stop? When will we feel comfortable sending kids to school or going to restaurants or riding the bus or even passing someone on the sidewalk — let alone going to a crowded stadium?</p>

<p>When you’ve been told that every aspect of your daily routine has the potential to kill your loved ones, how do you go back?</p>

<p>As models increasingly show that Washington state is flattening the curve, The Seattle Times dispatched reporters to examine critical issues, from COVID-19 deaths to hospitalizations to supply chains for critical protective and testing equipment. The goal: to get a better sense of where we are now — what we know, and what we don’t.</p>
