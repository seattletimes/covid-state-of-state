        <p>Daily death totals from COVID-19 have climbed erratically — but climbed nonetheless — over the past two weeks, with more than 20 deaths a day reported nine days in a row through April 10.</p>
        <p>When comparing Washington deaths to the number of confirmed cases, it’s a staggering death rate of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/interactive-map-coronavirus-pandemic-track-outbreak-washington-united-states-world/" target="blank">nearly 4.8 percent of those infected</a>, compared with 3.7 percent nationally and 4.6 percent in New York, the eye of the COVID-19 storm in the U.S. right now. For states with at least 10,000 confirmed cases, only Michigan had a higher death rate as of Friday at 5.7 percent.</p>

        <p>Washington state DOH officials say those numbers are skewed by erratic and sluggish testing and other variables. Dr. Kathy Lofy, the state’s chief public health officer, believes a more accurate — if constantly shifting — view can be had using COVID-19 deaths per capita.</p>
        <p>By that count, Washington’s COVID-19 death rate was 6.3 deaths for every 100,000 residents. New York was experiencing 40.4 deaths for every 100,000 residents; New Jersey and Louisiana — two other national hot spots — were seeing death rates of just over 21.8 and 16.2 deaths per 100,000 residents, respectively.</p>
        <p>Using population figures and known deaths — while also likely an undercount — provides at least a view of where the virus is concentrated and promulgating, Lofy said. However, the real extent of the virus’s devastation won’t be known for months or years.</p>

<div class="maxWrap">
<p>What is clear is that, in Washington, the death numbers were out of proportion early on due to the outbreak at the Life Care Center of Kirkland and a cascade of deaths among vulnerable residents at other nursing homes and care facilities. At <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/at-least-137-long-term-care-facilities-in-washington-have-coronavirus-cases/" target="blank">least 200 of the state’s deaths</a> were in senior care or group living facilities.</p>

<div class="maxWrap">
  <p>One number the state of Washington isn’t currently exploring: a count of people who have “recovered” from COVID-19, a figure kept by some other states and countries. Lofy said her investigators are too busy tracking new lines of infection to circle back on the more than 8,500 people who tested positive, got sick and didn’t die.</p>
